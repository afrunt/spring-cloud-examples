## What's your superhero name?
Enter your initials and find the answer :)

This is the example with 3 REST Services and single consumer.
Services and consumer uses Eureka for service discovery.
Consumer (superhero-name-web) uses Ribbon for client-side load balancing and Hystrix for circuit breaking.

Build the project:
```bash
mvn clean package docker:build
```

Go to superhero directory:
```bash
cd superhero-name
```

Run docker-compose to start all applications:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to see the Eureka dashboard to ensure that everything is up and running

to get the answer
![answer](static/answer.png "answer")
refresh the page to get some service crash (each of three REST services will crash when System.currentTimeMillis() % 10 == 0)

When all 3 REST services are down, you will always get the name "Stupid Jumping Skunk", since this value is generated by Hystrix fallbacks.

Turn off REST services
Run docker-compose to start all applications:
```bash
docker-compose stop first-inittial-service
```

```bash
docker-compose stop middle-inittial-service
```

```bash
docker-compose stop last-inittial-service
```
